	<p class="title">Imagine this:</p>
	<p class="paragraph">
	<br>It's early. Too early. Especially too early for a weekend morning. Four girls walk onto MIT campus. They had met the day before. The very next day, all of their knowledge would be put to the test, and they would have to make a working website before six o'clock that evening. They had an idea. A ridiculous (yet somehow brilliant?) idea. They decided to make something with quotes and funny jokes. Because you know, who doesn't like funny jokes, right?
	<br><br><br><br></p>
	<p class="title">Here's what they came up with.</p>
	<p class="paragraph">
	<br>Welcome to a website full of funny jokes, quotes, and memes. Click on "random" to get a random quote or meme. Once you're on that page, you must click your browser's refresh button in order to receive a new quote. Go to "archive" to see all the quotes and jokes we have to offer. If you've selected "about", you're probably reading this right now.
