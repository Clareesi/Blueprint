	<p class="paragraph">
	<br><br>It's early. Too early. Four girls walk onto MIT campus; they met the day before. They have to make a working website before six o'clock that evening, and decide to make something with quotes and funny jokes. Who doesn't like funny jokes, right?
	<br><br><br><br></p>
	<p class="title">Here's what they came up with.</p>
	<p class="paragraph">
	<br><br>A website full of funny jokes, quotes, and memes. Click on "random" to get a random quote or meme. Go to "archive" to see all the quotes and jokes we have to offer. If you've selected "about", you're probably reading this right now.
